## Description ##  
The purpose of my portfolio website is to demonstrate my abilities as a Novice Developer and I.T Professional showcasing information about myself, skills, interests, professional knowledge and projects. Though the blog and project pages are currently filled with placeholder content, my own future experiences and work will replace them in time.  

My website has 5 HTML documents which are linked to 1 CSS file. These webpages have relevant information and a simple design suitable for users on phones, tablets and desktops.

Below are the Sitemap, Wireframe/Mockup pages of my website and the end product website pages:  
  

The main page is the Home Page which can access all other pages via a navigation bar. This is also available to every page as the navigation bar has been created for each document. By doing so it gives the user a better, faster and simple experience when using the website.
